## Level 0: The Foundations {#level-0-foundations}

### What is Data?

Before we can detect anomalies, we must understand what data is.

**Data** is a collection of observations or measurements. For example:
Daily temperatures: [20¬∞C, 21¬∞C, 19¬∞C, 22¬∞C, 20¬∞C, 45¬∞C, 21¬∞C]

### What is "Normal"?

Most of the data follows a **pattern**:

- Temperatures are usually around 20-22¬∞C
- One value (45¬∞C) is very different
- This different value is an **anomaly** or **outlier**

**Key Insight**: To find anomalies, we first need to understand what "normal" looks like.

### The Central Question

> _"How do we mathematically define what is 'normal' vs 'anomalous'?"_

This is what anomaly detection algorithms answer.

---

## Level 1: Basic Statistics {#level-1-basic-statistics}

### Measure of Center: The Mean

The **mean** (average) tells us the "typical" value.

**Formula**: mean = (sum of all values) / (count of values)

**Example**:

```python
data = [20, 21, 19, 22, 20]
mean = (20 + 21 + 19 + 22 + 20) / 5 = 102 / 5 = 20.4¬∞C
```

**Intuition**: The mean is the "balance point" of your data.

### Measure of Spread: Variance and Standard Deviation

The **variance** tells us how spread out the data is.

**Formula**: variance = average of (each value - mean)¬≤

**Example**:

```python
data = [20, 21, 19, 22, 20]
mean = 20.4

differences = [20-20.4, 21-20.4, 19-20.4, 22-20.4, 20-20.4]
            = [-0.4, 0.6, -1.4, 1.6, -0.4]

squared = [0.16, 0.36, 1.96, 2.56, 0.16]
variance = (0.16 + 0.36 + 1.96 + 2.56 + 0.16) / 5 = 1.04

standard deviation (std) = ‚àövariance = ‚àö1.04 ‚âà 1.02¬∞C
```

**Intuition**:

- Low variance = data points are close together
- High variance = data points are spread out
- Standard deviation is in the same units as the data (easier to interpret)

### Why This Matters

If we know:

- **Mean**: The center of "normal"
- **Std Dev**: How much variation is "normal"

Then we can say: _"Values far from the mean (many std devs away) are anomalies"_

---

## Level 2: Understanding Distributions {#level-2-distributions}

### The Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)

Many real-world phenomena follow a **normal distribution**:

- | _
  | _
  | _
  | _
  --------|--------
  mean

  **Key Properties**:

* Most data is near the mean
* Symmetric (same on both sides)
* Follows the **68-95-99.7 rule**:
  - 68% of data within 1 std dev of mean
  - 95% of data within 2 std devs of mean
  - 99.7% of data within 3 std devs of mean

**Why This Matters**: If data is normally distributed, values beyond 3 std devs are very rare (<0.3% chance). These are likely anomalies!

### The Problem: Not All Data is Normal

Real data often has:

1. **Skewness**: Lopsided distributions
2. **Heavy tails**: More extreme values than expected
3. **Outliers**: Values that don't fit the pattern

**Example**:
Income distribution:
Most people: $30k-$80k
A few people: $1M+ ‚Üê These pull the mean up!

When we have outliers, the mean and variance become **contaminated** - they're influenced by the very anomalies we're trying to detect!

**This is a fundamental problem we'll solve with robust statistics.**

---

## Level 3: What Makes an Anomaly? {#level-3-anomalies}

### Three Types of Anomalies

1. **Point Anomalies**: Single values that are unusual

   ```
   [20, 21, 19, 100, 22, 20]  ‚Üê 100 is a point anomaly
   ```

2. **Contextual Anomalies**: Normal value but wrong context

   ```
   Summer temperatures: [25, 26, 5, 27, 28]  ‚Üê 5¬∞C is anomalous in summer
   ```

3. **Collective Anomalies**: Sequence that's unusual
   ```
   Heart rate: [70, 72, 71, 190, 195, 200, 73, 71]  ‚Üê The spike is collective
   ```

Our app focuses on **point anomalies** in time-series data.

### The Statistical Definition

An anomaly is a data point that is **statistically improbable** given the distribution of other data points.

**Mathematically**:
If P(x | data) < threshold, then x is an anomaly
Where:
P(x | data) = probability of seeing x given our data
threshold = our tolerance for false alarms

---

## Level 4: Classical Detection Methods {#level-4-classical-methods}

### Method 1: Z-Score (Standard Score)

**The Idea**: Measure how many standard deviations a point is from the mean.

**Formula**:
z-score = (x - mean) / std_dev

**Interpretation**:

- z = 0: Exactly at the mean
- z = 1: One std dev above mean
- z = -2: Two std devs below mean
- |z| > 3: Very unusual! (Anomaly)

**Example**:

```python
data = [20, 21, 19, 22, 20, 45]  # 45¬∞C is suspicious
mean = 24.5 (contaminated by 45!)
std = 10.14

z-score for 45 = (45 - 24.5) / 10.14 = 2.02

Threshold = 3
2.02 < 3, so NOT flagged as anomaly! ‚ùå
```

**The Problem**: The anomaly itself contaminates the mean and std, making it harder to detect!

### Method 2: IQR (Interquartile Range)

**The Idea**: Use quartiles (less affected by outliers).

**Quartiles**:

- Q1 (25th percentile): 25% of data below this
- Q2 (50th percentile): The median
- Q3 (75th percentile): 75% of data below this

**Formula**:
IQR = Q3 - Q1
Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5 √ó IQR
Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5 √ó IQR
If x < lower bound OR x > upper bound: Anomaly!

**Why 1.5?**: John Tukey (1977) found this works well empirically. For normal distribution, this catches ~0.7% as outliers.

**Example**:

```python
data = [19, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 45]
        Q1=20    Q2=21    Q3=22

IQR = 22 - 20 = 2
Lower = 20 - 1.5(2) = 17
Upper = 22 + 1.5(2) = 25

45 > 25, so ANOMALY! ‚úì
```

**Advantage**: Q1 and Q3 aren't as affected by the outlier 45.

---

## Level 5: Robust Statistics {#level-5-robust-statistics}

### The Problem with Mean and Variance

**Mean is not robust**:
data = [20, 21, 19, 22, 20]
mean = 20.4 ‚úì
data = [20, 21, 19, 22, 20, 1000] # Add one outlier
mean = 183.7 ‚ùå # Completely changed!

One bad value ruins everything. This is called **low breakdown point**.

### The Solution: Robust Estimators

**Robust statistics** resist the influence of outliers.

#### 1. Median (Robust Center)

**Definition**: The middle value when data is sorted.

```python
data = [19, 20, 20, 21, 22]
median = 20  # Middle value

data = [19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 1000]  # Add outlier
median = 20.5  # Barely changed! ‚úì
```

**Breakdown Point**: 50% - can handle up to 50% of data being outliers!

#### 2. MAD: Median Absolute Deviation (Robust Spread)

**Formula**:
MAD = median(|x - median(x)|)

**Step-by-step**:

```python
data = [19, 20, 20, 21, 22]

Step 1: Find median
median = 20

Step 2: Calculate absolute deviations
deviations = [|19-20|, |20-20|, |20-20|, |21-20|, |22-20|]
           = [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]

Step 3: Find median of deviations
MAD = median([1, 0, 0, 1, 2]) = 1
```

**Why This Matters**: MAD is like standard deviation but robust to outliers!

**Comparison**:

```python
data = [20, 21, 19, 22, 20]
std = 1.02
MAD = 1.0  # Similar

data = [20, 21, 19, 22, 20, 1000]  # Add outlier
std = 398.7  ‚ùå # Ruined
MAD = 1.0    ‚úì  # Still good!
```

### Modified Z-Score

Using robust statistics, we can create a robust version of z-score:

**Formula**:
Modified Z-score = 0.6745 √ó |x - median| / MAD

**Where does 0.6745 come from?**
For normal distribution, MAD ‚âà 0.6745 √ó std_dev. This scaling factor makes MAD comparable to standard deviation.

**Threshold**: Iglewicz & Hoaglin (1993) recommend 3.5 for modified z-score.

---

## Level 6: Our Four Algorithms {#level-6-algorithms}

Now we understand enough to see why we chose these specific algorithms!

### Algorithm 1: Z-Score Detection

**What It Does**: Measures deviation from mean in units of standard deviation.

**When to Use**:

- Data is approximately normally distributed
- No major outliers in the data
- You want a simple, fast method

**Strengths**:

- ‚úÖ Very fast: O(n) with Welford's algorithm
- ‚úÖ Well-understood and interpretable
- ‚úÖ Works well for Gaussian data

**Weaknesses**:

- ‚ùå Sensitive to outliers (contamination)
- ‚ùå Assumes normal distribution
- ‚ùå Mean and std can be misleading if outliers exist

**Example Use Case**: Detecting sensor failures in a well-calibrated, stable system.

### Algorithm 2: Modified Z-Score (MAD)

**What It Does**: Like Z-score but uses median and MAD (robust statistics).

**When to Use**:

- Data has outliers
- Distribution is unknown or non-normal
- You need the most robust method
- Small sample sizes

**Strengths**:

- ‚úÖ **Most robust**: 50% breakdown point
- ‚úÖ Works with any distribution
- ‚úÖ Recommended by NIST and statistical literature
- ‚úÖ Great for contaminated data

**Weaknesses**:

- ‚ùå Slower: O(n¬≤ log n) due to median calculations
- ‚ùå Not ideal for very large datasets

**Example Use Case**: Financial fraud detection where outliers are what you're looking for.

**Our Choice**: This is the **default recommended method** (üèÜ in the UI).

### Algorithm 3: Moving Average

**What It Does**: Uses a sliding window of recent data with robust statistics.

**Why Moving Windows?**: Data changes over time!

**Example**:
Temperature trend:
January (cold): [5, 6, 4, 7, 5] ‚Üê Normal range
July (hot): [28, 29, 27, 30, 29] ‚Üê Different normal range!

Static mean = 17.5¬∞C would flag all January values as too cold and all July values as too hot. But they're both normal for their season!

**Solution**: Only look at recent data (e.g., last 20 points).

**When to Use**:

- Data has trends (increasing/decreasing over time)
- Seasonal patterns exist
- "Normal" changes over time
- Streaming data

**Strengths**:

- ‚úÖ Adapts to trends and seasonality
- ‚úÖ Uses robust statistics (median & MAD)
- ‚úÖ Good balance of robustness and adaptability

**Weaknesses**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower to detect anomalies (needs full window)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Window size is a tuning parameter

**Example Use Case**: Website traffic monitoring (daily/weekly patterns).

**Our Implementation**: Uses median and MAD in the window for robustness!

### Algorithm 4: IQR (Tukey's Method)

**What It Does**: Uses quartiles to define normal range, based on box plots.

**The Box Plot Connection**:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚Üê Q3 (75th percentile)
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§ ‚Üê Median (Q2)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚Üê Q1 (25th percentile)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
Whiskers extend to:
Lower: Q1 - 1.5√óIQR
Upper: Q3 + 1.5√óIQR
Beyond whiskers = outliers!

**When to Use**:

- Skewed distributions (not symmetric)
- You want a visual interpretation (box plots)
- Classic, well-understood method
- Data has a clear middle bulk

**Strengths**:

- ‚úÖ Robust (quartiles less affected by outliers)
- ‚úÖ Classic method (Tukey 1977)
- ‚úÖ Works well with skewed data
- ‚úÖ Visual and interpretable

**Weaknesses**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less powerful than MAD for some cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiplier (1.5) is somewhat arbitrary

**Example Use Case**: Quality control in manufacturing (detecting defective products).

## Level 7: Design Decisions {#level-7-design-decisions}

Now let's understand WHY we made specific implementation choices.

### Decision 1: Online Algorithms

**The Problem**:

```python
# Naive approach (WRONG for real-time):
mean = np.mean(all_data)  # Includes future data!
```

**Our Solution**: Only use **historical data**.

```python
# Correct approach:
for i in range(1, len(data)):
    historical = data[:i]  # Only past
    mean = np.mean(historical)
    # Detect anomaly in data[i]
```

**Why**: In real-time streaming, future data doesn't exist yet!

**Academic Term**: This is called **online** or **streaming** algorithm.

### Decision 2: Welford's Algorithm (O(n) Variance)

**The Problem**: Naive online approach is O(n¬≤):

```python
# Slow O(n¬≤):
for i in range(n):
    historical = data[:i]
    mean = np.mean(historical)  # O(i) operation
    # Total: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = O(n¬≤)
```

**The Solution**: Update mean and variance incrementally!

**Welford's Algorithm** (1962):

```python
n = 0
mean = 0
M2 = 0  # Sum of squared differences

for x in data:
    n += 1
    delta = x - mean
    mean += delta / n        # Update mean: O(1)
    delta2 = x - mean
    M2 += delta * delta2     # Update variance: O(1)

    variance = M2 / (n-1)    # Calculate: O(1)
```

**Result**: O(1) per point √ó n points = **O(n) total**!

**Performance Gain**:

- 100 points: 10x faster
- 1,000 points: 100x faster
- 10,000 points: **1000x faster**!

**This is why we use Welford's algorithm for Z-score.**

### Decision 3: Minimum Sample Size

**The Problem**: Statistics on tiny samples are meaningless.

**Example**:

```python
data = [20]  # One point
median = 20
MAD = median(|20-20|) = 0

Next point: 21
Modified z-score = 0.6745 √ó |21-20| / 0 = ‚àû (division by zero!)
```

**The Solution**: Enforce minimum samples based on literature.

**Our Choices**:

- Z-Score: 10 points minimum
- MAD: 10 points minimum
- Moving Average: 20 points (= window size)
- IQR: 20 points minimum

**Academic Basis**:

- Rousseeuw & Leroy (1987): Recommend 10-20 observations for robust statistics
- Statistical power analysis: Need adequate sample size for inference

**User Impact**: First 10-20 points show as "not checked" (warm-up period).

### Decision 4: Fixed vs Adaptive Window

**Original IQR Implementation**:

```python
window = min(50, len(data) // 2)  # CHANGES as data grows!
```

**The Problem**: Non-reproducible results!

**Example**:

```python
# Point #100 with value 200
Run 1 (total 300 points): window=150, uses data[0:100]  ‚Üí Detected
Run 2 (total 1000 points): window=500, uses data[0:100] ‚Üí Not detected

Same point, same data, DIFFERENT result! ‚ùå
```

**Our Solution**: Fixed window of 50 points.

```python
window = 50  # FIXED for all points
```

**Why 50?**:

- Large enough for stable statistics
- Small enough to adapt to changes
- Tukey didn't specify adaptive windows

**Result**: Same data always gives same results (reproducible).

### Decision 5: Robust Fallbacks

**The Problem**: When variance = 0, what do we do?

**Example**:

```python
data = [20, 20, 20, 20, 20]  # All the same
std = 0
MAD = 0

Next point: 21
z-score = |21-20| / 0 = ‚àû  # Division by zero!
```

**Bad Solution**: Fall back to non-robust std.

```python
if MAD == 0:
    use std  # ‚ùå Defeats purpose of robust method!
```

**Our Solution**: Chain of robust fallbacks.

```python
if MAD < epsilon:
    # Try IQR (also robust)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    if IQR > epsilon:
        MAD = IQR / 1.349  # Convert to MAD-equivalent
    else:
        # Last resort: exact comparison
        anomaly = |x - median| > epsilon
```

**Why**: Stay robust at every step!

### Decision 6: Threshold Consistency

**The Problem**: Different scales for different methods.

**Original**:

- Z-score: threshold = 3.0
- Moving Average: threshold = 2.5 ‚ùå (Why different?)
- MAD: threshold = 3.5

**Our Solution**: Moving Average now uses modified z-score scale.

```python
modified_z = 0.6745 √ó |x - median| / MAD
threshold = 3.5  # Same scale as MAD method
```

**Result**: Consistent interpretation across methods.

### Decision 7: Input Validation

**The Problem**: Garbage in, garbage out.

**Example Failures**:

```python
data = [20, np.nan, 22]  # NaN propagates
mean = np.mean(data) = nan
z-score = nan  # Useless!

data = []  # Empty
median([]) = Error!  # Crash!
```

**Our Solution**:

```python
def _validate_input(data):
    if len(data) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Empty data")
    if not np.isfinite(data).all():
        raise ValueError("Contains NaN/Inf")
    return np.array(data)
```

**Result**: Fail fast with clear error message instead of silent corruption.

---

## Level 8: Implementation Details {#level-8-implementation}

### Floating-Point Precision

**The Problem**:

```python
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3  # False in Python!
0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
```

**Why**: Binary representation of decimals is imprecise.

**Our Solution**: Use epsilon for comparisons.

```python
EPSILON = 1e-10

# Bad:
if std == 0:
    ...

# Good:
if std < EPSILON:
    ...

# Bad:
if value != median:
    ...

# Good:
if abs(value - median) > EPSILON:
    ...
```

**Result**: Handles floating-point errors gracefully.

### Memory Management

**The Problem**: Storing all historical data grows without bound.

**Our Solution**: Use deque with maxlen.

```python
from collections import deque

data = deque(maxlen=200)  # Keeps only last 200 points
data.append(new_value)     # Automatically drops oldest
```

**Trade-off**:

- ‚úÖ Constant memory: O(200) not O(n)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lose old data (but we don't need it for recent detection)

### Time-Space Complexity Summary

| Algorithm  | Time             | Space | Bottleneck             |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| Z-Score    | O(n)             | O(n)  | Welford's algorithm    |
| MAD        | O(n¬≤ log n)      | O(n)  | Median calculation √ó n |
| Moving Avg | O(n √ó w √ó log w) | O(n)  | Window median √ó n      |
| IQR        | O(n √ó w √ó log w) | O(n)  | Window percentiles √ó n |

Where:

- n = total data points
- w = window size (20-50)

**Why MAD is slower**: Must compute median over growing data at each step.

**For production**: Moving Average offers similar robustness with better performance.

2. **Visualize**: Study the real-time charts

   - When do methods agree/disagree?
   - What causes false positives/negatives?

3. **Compare**: Run different algorithms on same data

   - Which catches anomalies earliest?
   - Which has fewer false alarms?

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - All identical values
   - Gradual vs sudden anomalies
   - High noise vs low noise

## Glossary

**Anomaly**: A data point significantly different from others

**Breakdown Point**: Fraction of data that can be corrupted before statistic fails

**Contamination**: When outliers affect the statistics used to detect them

**IQR**: Interquartile Range, Q3 - Q1

**MAD**: Median Absolute Deviation, robust measure of spread

**Modified Z-Score**: Robust version of z-score using MAD

**Online Algorithm**: Processes data incrementally, suitable for streams

**Quartile**: Values dividing data into four equal parts

**Robust Statistics**: Statistics resistant to outliers

**Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance, measure of spread

**Variance**: Average squared deviation from mean

**Welford's Algorithm**: O(n) method for online variance

**Z-Score**: Number of standard deviations from mean
